# IUCN Red List History Crawler
Gets the history of changes to IUCN Red List status for a set of species.

Stuff that would be nice to add:
 - Replace status phrase (ex. 'Critically Endangered') with status abbreviation ('CR') in current assessment
 - Process the synonyms better
 - If species name that was searched isn't the main name it's filed under, get main name as well as synonyms
